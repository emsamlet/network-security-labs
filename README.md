# Network Security Labs Portfolio

This repository documents my hands-on projects using an iES26G enterprise switch 
to practice network security, monitoring, and compliance controls. I will periodically add more projects as I complete them.

Each folder contains:
- 📜 Config files (sanitized for security, where needed)
- 📷 Screenshots of testing
- 🗺️ Network diagrams
- 📄 Write-ups explaining purpose, setup, and results

## About Me
I am a growing and developing cybersecurity professional full of curiosity and a hunger to learn. My main interest lies in digital forensics; however, I had the opportunity to obtain an enterprise switch, so I'm focusing my time on learning basic switch networking and security. This lab showcases my practical skills and interest in protecting enterprise environments.
